a long time ago somewhere inside the indian rainforest, there lived a monkey on a plum tree.
he used used to collect the plums of the tree and ate them.
near the plum tree there was a river in which a crocodile lived.
the crocodile was a good freind of the monkey, but her wife was very cunning and did not liked the monkey.
